# ðŸ§® Excel Automation using Python

This project automates repetitive Excel tasks using Python â€” from creating spreadsheets and inserting data to applying styles, generating charts, and opening files directly in Microsoft Excel.

## ðŸ”§ What This Project Does

- Creates and updates Excel files (`.xlsx`)
- Automatically fills in cells with meaningful data
- Applies formatting and styling (fonts, colors, bold text)
- Generates simple and advanced Excel charts
- Opens the Excel file directly using the native Excel application (via COM automation)

> If you're someone who works with spreadsheets regularly, this script can save you hours of manual work.
